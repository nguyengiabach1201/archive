### Code Breakdown

-   **Y**: This single character is a sequential identifier for files archived on the same day. For example, the first file archived would be `A`, the second would be `B`, and so on.

### Example

A file named `240312BL.jpg` would have the following meaning:

-   **240312**: Archived on March 12, 2024.
-   **B**: The file type is `.jpg` (as shown in the table).
-   **L**: It's the 12th file of any type archived on that day.

> [!NOTE]
> The file extension on the filename itself is for convenience, but the code is the official identifier.

## Accessing a file via indirect URL

To access a file, simply navigate to the following URL format, replacing the code with your file's unique identifier:
`https://nguyengiabach.com/archive/YYMMDDXY`

### Example

To access `240312BL.jpg`, use the URL `https://nguyengiabach.com/archive/240312BL`.

### Accessing a file via direct URL

You can access a file by typing its full path directly into your browser's address bar. This is the recommended method for linking to any media.

> [!WARNING]
> When embedding an image, video, or other media file in HTML, you must always provide the full, correct path to the file. The short 8-character code alone will not work.

### Example

```html
<img
    src="http://nguyengiabach1201.github.io/archive/images/250821BA.jpg"
    alt="The Longma at Quoc Hoc's tráº¥n phong"
/>
```
